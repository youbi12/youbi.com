***BEFORE UPDATING***
Due to envato requirements changes we need to push widgets to plugins and in order for you to save them 
you need to do what is described in tutorial bellow. This is required only this time:
1. Go to Plugins -> Add New and install & activate plugin Widget Importer & Exporter
2. Go to Tools -> Widget Importer & Exporter and click Export and then save the file
3. Go to Plugins and deactivate and delete plugin Couponis Demo Importer
4. Update theme
4. Install & activate Couponis Demo Importer
5. Go to Tools -> Widget Importer & Exporter, Choose file to import ( your saved file from step 2 ) and click Import
6. You can now disable and remove Widget Importer & Exporter

***IF YOU ARE USING CHILD THEME TO OVERWRITE THEME FILES KEEP READING OTHERWISE IGNORE AND JUST UDPATE****
In order to be compilant with new envato rules we had to move things from theme to plugin. This is done in such way
so your child themes continue to be functional. From now on when you search for some things in theme files you need also to look in plugin ( wp-content/plugins/couponis-demo ). 
Good news are that nothing was changed in organization of files only their location is moved from theme to plugin and you can use your child theme to overwritte plugin files without issues
